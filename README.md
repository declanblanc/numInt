# Numerical Integration Calculator (Version 1.3.0)
Thanks for checking out my project!  

My name is [Declan Blanchard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/declanblanc/) and I created this project for Professor Nikitovic's Calculus 2 Spring 2024 course!  

With no prior experience in JavaScipt, HTML, or CSS, this project was an opportunity to challenge my ability to learn new languages and concepts on my own in a short period of time.
